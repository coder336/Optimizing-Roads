# Optimizing-Roads
This is an algorithm for assigning directions in a bidirectional network of roads such that every city is connected to each other and each road is unidirectional.
The input is taken as number of cities and number of roads and then each road is represented by two numbers representing a road. The output will be given as a undirectional roads except for bridges which are bidirectional.
